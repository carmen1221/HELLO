            This project first started out with a study of an assigned kitchen utensil. The project was carried out in a way that students first had to draft five sections through the object. The drawings later progressed into different iterations of the utensil in motion. The next phase transitioned students into drawing sections through the motion. Students were also assigned a partner in which both sections were joined together and various studies models were made to depict both motions of both utensils. The final model is to be made entirely of poplar and ash using no glue, only jointery.
