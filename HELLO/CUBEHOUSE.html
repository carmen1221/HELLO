            The program is divided into a series of hirarchy of spaces where smaller spaces gradually flow into larger spaces. Starting from the top of the site, a narrow passage way brings wedding guests into the  garden viewing area. Guests are later able to transition into the reception either through the wedding pavillion or the path in front of it. 
The pavillion is made the center of attention in the site in which it serves as a ceremony space on the first floor. On the second floor however, it is made into a changing area where guests are able to experience a balcony view while hypothetically being in the lake. The site of the wedding has no closed spaces which mimics the design of the pavillion.
